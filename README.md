# Task Management Discord Bot

This is a simple Discord bot built using Python and `discord.py` for managing tasks. The bot allows you to add, delete, show, and mark tasks as completed. It uses SQLite for storing the tasks and their statuses.

## Features
- **Add Task**: Adds a new task with a description.
- **Delete Task**: Deletes a task by its ID.
- **Show Tasks**: Lists all the tasks with their current status (completed or not).
- **Complete Task**: Marks a task as completed.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.8+** is required.
2. **discord.py** library to interact with the Discord API.
3. **SQLite** for task storage.

```

### 2. Install Dependencies
